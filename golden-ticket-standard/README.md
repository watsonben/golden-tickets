# What it do?
This is a lil python program that guides you through the process of making a JIRA comment that follows a "Golden Standard", providing all the information you should be providing.

# How I do?
I recommend adding the python script in and aliasing the command so you can use it from wherever you wanna.

>
1. Copy/paste the `make-golden-ticket.py` and `printing.py` files into somewhere (I'ma use `~/Documents/golden-ticket-standard`)
2. Add a new alias into your `~/.bash_aliases` file: `alias gold="python ~/Documents/golden-ticket-standard/make-golden-ticket.py"` (or wherever your file is stored, idk your life).
3. Use it. Type `gold` from anywhere and follow the instructions.

# Do more.
Maybe I'll integrate this with JIRA in the future to make it actually send the comment for you so you have to do even less work and then maybe you can stop complaining.

UPDATE: I am not doing this. No. Do it yourself.

# Thanks.
You're welcome.
